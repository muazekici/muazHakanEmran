# muazHakanEmran - Android



## Project Proposal

It is a project for better utilizing and organizing recycling facilities. 

The android app will work as a platform to meet the people recyling their wastes with the people that collect them. 
In our initial MVP we plan to support one type of recycling product(can be extended to more if the time allows). There are two main use cases.

Users can move their wastes to nearby and frequent recycling vendors and they will be awarded when they put their wastes to the vendors. They will use the app to find nearby vendors and submit their wastes.

Users can collect the wastes from the vendors and transport them to one of the recyling factories. The app will be used to find the best route that maximizes the amount recyled in the given limits (time, distance travelled, etc). 

Each vendor has also a capacity for the waste. 

We also plan to add the feature of giving the wastes directly to the transporters, again if the time allows.
